## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone!

I'm Niko, a student of Web Developement, UI-Design and Low-Code Solutions.

I have been involved in various ICT projects for over 20 years. Now, my goal and dream is to work professionally in the ICT field.

My strengths include Front-End Development and User Interface Design. Currently, I am focusing on web development languages, such as JavaScript, as well as HTML, CSS, and PHP.

I am currently working on a website to showcase my portfolio, but in the meantime, I am sharing my projects here on GitHub.
